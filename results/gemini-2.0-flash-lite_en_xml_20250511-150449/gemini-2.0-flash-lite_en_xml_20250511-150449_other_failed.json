It includes clauses about neutrality, cooperation, and consultation.\\n\\n2. **Analyze the Answer Choices:**\\n    *   **A) Munich Agreement (1938):** This agreement involved appeasement, where Britain and France conceded territory to Germany to avoid war. It's not a pact of non-aggression.\\n    *   **B) Triple Entente (1907):** This was an alliance between Great Britain, France, and Russia, designed to counter the Central Powers. It's not a non-aggression pact.\\n    *   **C) Lateran Treaty (1929):** This treaty resolved the Roman Question by establishing Vatican City as an independent state. Not relevant.\\n    *   **D) Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916):** This was a secret agreement between Britain and France to divide up the Ottoman Empire.
