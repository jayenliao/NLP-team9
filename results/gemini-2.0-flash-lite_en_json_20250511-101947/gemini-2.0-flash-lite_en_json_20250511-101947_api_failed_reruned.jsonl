It aimed to restore the old order, which anarchists directly opposed. This is unlikely to be the correct answer as anarchism opposed the restoration of the old order, and the congress was a part of it.\\n    *   B) The International Workingman's Association: This association, also known as the First International, was a labor organization that included various socialist and anarchist factions. This is very likely related to anarchism.\\n    *   C) The Paris Commune: The Paris Commune (1871) was a revolutionary government in Paris. It was a short-lived, radical socialist/anarchist experiment. Therefore, it is related.\\n    *   D) Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809-1865) was a French socialist and the first person to call himself an anarchist. He is directly related to the movement.\\n\\n4.  **Determine the Exception:** The Congress of Vienna, occurred before the rise of modern anarchism.

It was a military alliance, formed to counterbalance the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy) before World War I. This is a stark contrast to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.\\n\\n*   **B: Munich Agreement (1938):** This agreement involved Germany, Great Britain, France, and Italy, and it allowed Germany to annex parts of Czechoslovakia. This is dissimilar to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact as it did not involved the USSR.\\n\\n*   **C: Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916):** This was a secret agreement between Great Britain and France, with the assent of Russia, to divide up Ottoman territories in the Middle East. This is not comparable to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.\\n\\n*   **D: Lateran Treaty (1929):** This treaty established Vatican City as an independent state and settled the Roman Question (the relationship between the Italian government and the papacy).

The passage is a satirical excerpt from Voltaire\\'s *Candide*, which critiques the philosophical optimism of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.

The question asks us to identify which other philosopher shares the critiques presented in the excerpt.\\n\\n*   **A: David Hume:** Hume was a prominent Enlightenment philosopher known for his skepticism and empiricism.

Hume’s skepticism and questioning of established beliefs align well with the satirical critique present in *Candide*.\\n\\n*   **B: Cesare Beccaria:** Beccaria was an Italian criminologist and economist. His work focused on criminal justice reform and the penal system. While his views align with some of the enlightened ideals of challenging established norms, his focus is more narrow than the broad critique of philosophical optimism presented by Voltaire.\\n\\n*   **C: Adam Smith:** Smith was a key figure in the development of modern economics and a proponent of free markets. Although he was a major figure of the Enlightenment, his work, while critiquing mercantilism, doesn\\'t directly address the philosophical optimism that Voltaire satirizes.\\n\\n*   **D: Jean-Jacques Rousseau:** Rousseau was an influential philosopher known for his views on social contract theory, political philosophy, and his concept of the \"noble savage\".

He satirized the philosophical optimism of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. We need to identify another Enlightenment figure who shared similar critical views.\\n\\n*   **A) David Hume:** Hume was a Scottish philosopher known for his empiricism and skepticism.

He advocated for more humane and rational legal systems. Although an Enlightenment figure, his focus was on legal reform, not the broader skepticism of Voltaire.\\n*   **D) Jean-Jacques Rousseau:** Rousseau was a Swiss philosopher known for his ideas on social contract theory, the general will, and the importance of the natural state of man.
